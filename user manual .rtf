Uno Game Guidelines\
1. Game Initialization:\
\
Your Uno game starts with a 108-card deck, comprising four colors (red, yellow, green, blue), numbers from 0 to 9, special action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two), and Wild cards (Wild and Wild Draw Four).\
\
The game accommodates two to four players. Each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards, drawn from a shuffled deck.\
\
To commence, the top card from the draw pile is placed face-up on the discard pile.\
\
2. Playing the Game:\
\
Participants take turns, proceeding in a clockwise manner.\
\
During a player's turn, they must make a choice: either play a card from their hand that matches the color or number of the top card on the discard pile or draw a card from the draw pile. If the drawn card is playable, it can be instantly used.\
\
Special action cards operate as follows:\
\
Skip: The next player in line is skipped.\
Reverse: The direction of play is reversed.\
Draw Two: The next player draws two cards and forfeits their turn.\
Wild cards can be played at any moment, enabling the player to designate the next color.\
\
When a Wild Draw Four card is played, the player picks the next color, and the following player must draw four cards and lose their turn.\
\
3. Victory Condition:\
\
The primary goal is to be the first player to eliminate all cards from their hand, resulting in a win.\
4. Game Regulations and Consequences:\
\
Should a player overlook saying "Uno" when left with just one card, they incur a penalty, drawing two additional cards.\
\
In the event of a player deploying a Wild card while holding a card of the current color, other participants have the option to challenge the move. An unsuccessful challenge results in the challenger drawing four cards, whereas a successful challenge causes the player who played the Wild card to draw four cards.\
\
5. Tailoring the Game:\
\
For added complexity and excitement, contemplate introducing customizable rules. For example, you can introduce the concept of stacking Draw Two cards, where successive Draw Two cards make the next player draw the cumulative total.\
6. Game Conclusion:\
\
The game persists until a player successfully clears their hand, at which point they are declared the victor.\
